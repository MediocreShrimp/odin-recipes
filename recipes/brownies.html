        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These easy chocolate brownies are rich and fudgy, and come together in minutes.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 tablespoons (145 grams) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups (250 grams) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (80 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1/4 rounded teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 large cold eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (65 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup (75 grams) chopped walnuts or pecans, optional</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 325 degrees F. Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch x 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on opposite sides to help remove the baked brownies from the pan.</li>
            <li>Prepare a double-boiler by filling a medium saucepan with water about 2 inches deep. Heat the water until barely simmering.</li>
            <li>Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium heat-safe bowl. Rest the bowl over the simmering water. If the bottom of the bowl touches the water, remove a little water from the saucepan.</li>
            <li>Stir the mixture occasionally until the butter has melted and the mixture is quite warm. Don’t worry if it looks gritty; it will become smooth once you add the eggs and flour.</li>
            <li>Remove the bowl from the saucepan, and set aside for 5 minutes or until it is only warm, not hot.</li>
            <li>Stir in the vanilla.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one.</li>
            <li>When the batter looks thick and well blended, add the flour. Use a spoon to beat the flour into the batter until it is very thick and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. We use a wooden spoon or spatula and beat for 40 to 50 strokes (see video for reference).</li>
            <li>Stir in nuts if using.</li>
        </ol>
